# Facebook-Auto-Login-using-Selenium

Selenium is designed to automate web browser interaction. It is primarily used to write scripts for actions users might take on your website, testing site functionality much faster than you could by hand. A short Selenium test might confirm that the browser can load a page at all, while a more complex test could automate an entire journey from log-in to a shopping cart.

to get the code started we first need to need to install a couple things:

1)Selenium, which allows you to control browsers from Python( try pip install selenium)
2)ChromeDriver, which allows software to control Chrome (like Selenium!)

Note : make sure the chromedriver is in the script file of python folder
